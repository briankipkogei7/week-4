      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Kipkogei, and I am taking this class to learn web development skills. I have a passion for creating web applications and want to enhance my knowledge in HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>I am particularly interested in front-end development because it allows me to combine my creativity with technical skills. I enjoy working on projects that involve designing user interfaces and improving user experiences.</p>
      <p>In addition to web development, I have interests in graphic design and photography. These hobbies complement my development skills by providing a strong sense of aesthetics and visual storytelling.</p>

    <section id="my-avatar">
      <h2>My Avatar: Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p>For this project, I have chosen to create a website based on the avatar of <em>Ada Lovelace</em>. Ada was a renowned mathematician and writer, primarily known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
      <p><strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> is often considered to be the first computer programmer. Her contributions to the field of computing were groundbreaking, and she is celebrated for her visionary insights into the potential of computers.</p>
      <p>I chose Ada Lovelace as my avatar because she represents the intersection of creativity and technology, which is a source of inspiration for my own work in web development. Her story encourages me to explore innovative solutions and push the boundaries of what is possible with technology.</p>

      <h2>Why Web Development Matters</h2>
      <p>My journey into web development began with a simple desire to create my own website. Over time, this interest evolved into a passion for coding and building interactive web applications. I find the process of bringing ideas to life through code to be incredibly fulfilling.</p>
      <p>Web development offers a unique blend of problem-solving and creativity. It challenges me to think critically and come up with efficient solutions while also allowing me to express my artistic side through design.</p>
      <p>Looking forward, I aspire to work on projects that have a positive impact on people's lives. Whether it's through developing accessible websites, creating engaging user experiences, or contributing to open-source projects, I want my work to make a difference.</p>
